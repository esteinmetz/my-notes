# Description
The benevolent Guild of the Healing Mage Organization—or HMO for short—is a guild that exists ostensibly to provide magical healing to whosoever needs it. We provide that healing magic to people who qualify according to their standards and saddle them with a reasonable fee.

Those who can’t afford to pay it, are offered an alternative payment plan of blood (xp).  Contracts are signed, but are they magical?  #todo

Note: material costs are included in price.
Note2: if they can't afford alternate we make a deal (payment plan).  If stiffed...we take everything they own, extract liquid pain from them and their families.

	1. Lock them up until they pay their debts (if they rest a day can we drain them again)?
	2. Test diseases on them?
	3. Some other way?
