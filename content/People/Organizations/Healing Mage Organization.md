# Description
The benevolent Guild of the Healing Mage Organization—or HMO for short—is a guild that exists ostensibly to provide magical healing to whosoever needs it. They gather together bards, clerics, wizards with access to cure light wounds and celestial-pact warlocks, and paladins, even necromancers. They then provide that healing magic to people who qualify according to their standards and saddle them with a reasonable fee.

Those who can’t afford to pay it (which is anyone who isn’t a noble), are offered an “alternative cure” whereby their symptoms are relieved because they’ve been turned into a zombie, or a skeleton, or a wight or a ghoul, take your pick, the HMO profits whether you’re alive or undead.
