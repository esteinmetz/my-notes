Current state: DECEASED
A [[Fargo Wells|Wellsman]] we originally found in a wall and saved.  Eventually the stress of the events caused him to die of a heart attack...

He's super young, a momma's boy who's dad is a dead drunk.  He performed lots of "rural deliveries" and organized banditry.  He's not good w/ horses, so didn't do much courier work.

1. Has 2 families in 2 cities and 2 side chicks.
2. We returned his insurance folder to [[Fargo Wells]]
