# #altar 
We found an altar early on the [[Fargo Wells]] were delivering the #lightOrb to.  The altar is definitely some kind of planar targeting structure, but not much more is known.

# #lightOrb 
We've collected 3, currently carried by:
1. [[Krebsbach (Erik)]]
2. [[Vekea Thulgiaga (Niki)]]
3. [[Met (Derek)]]

These are extremely powerful magic, probably conjuration & divination (like teleportation or plane shift), but are hard to identify because they're veiled.

Info on magical storage batteries was sent to an [[unnamed master]] in [[Alewick]] at the [[Union of the Saffron Moon]] in the Southern Duchy of Flemash.
