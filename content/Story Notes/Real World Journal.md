Session 3/22: #todo 
Alex joins!
We get to [[Mossley]] (after 2 days travel).
Derek and I head to [[Frank Lechner]].
- Alex has the airship book (he's delivering the book to "a practicer of arcane arts" in [[Alewick]])
- Shelf of disease books.
- Frank Lechner gives me a coin (he asks for 25k and I give him 26k to keep similar books for me)
