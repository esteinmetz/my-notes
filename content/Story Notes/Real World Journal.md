# Session 2/1/2025
Ancient silver dragon crashes in the area, (early rough symbol) image of [[Tiamat]] branded on the dragon’s back.  Autopsy shows death probably from dragon fight including acid burns.  Most likely either black or green dragon.  We resurrected it, its name is [[Moon Watcher]].

[[Tiamat]] brand can control dragons (early ones can fight back).  He says he was killed by a black.  [[Tiamat]] is trying to control everything…kobolds are completely under her control.

Alter from the beginning of the game is closing (or maybe opening) a seal.  Orbs are super magic batteries.  #altar #lightOrb 

[[Moon Watcher]] gave us nothing other than a little information.

In [[Warthfeld]], 2 grannies ([[Petunia]] and [[Opal]]) have old people problems.  I heal them, and also birth a calf.  [[Warthfeld]] is FUCKING BORING!!!!!

# Session 12/14/2024
Brian talks to an apprentice named [[Cletus]] about battle magic and breaking into the opposing schools to spike their food.  It includes animated statues and such.

Crystal saw “human” children NE of [[Hupeni]], they’re looking for the #lightOrb  we have.  She messed with them and they turned into deep green dragons.

Erik/Derek meets with poisoner (a [[Jaegar]]) and told to feel free to come back if they need more.

NOTE: [[Nikolas Salvie (aka Nikolaj)|Nikolaj]] wants to get to the [[Union of the Saffron Moon]] in [[Alewick]].

# Session 9/21/2024:
Approaching [[Kisaw]] (small village outside [[Arkala City]]). Have dinner.  Niki starts seeing people.  We leave and convince her to switch vestiges…then head to [[Arkala City]].

Use [[Castel Inn]] as a meetup.  Niki partying.  Crystal heads to the alchemist.  Erik heads to Engineering library: [[Borsek]] (Derek catches up).  Their research grants +8 bonus to an Engineering check for airships. #airship 

Erik sets up a sale for a bunch of poison (only Derek knows).


# Session 6/29/2024:
[[Nikolas Salvie (aka Nikolaj)|Nikolaj]] uses his foldable inn for the first time to take cover from an approaching [[Magic Storm]].  During the storm an Iron Golem appears, we defeat it and remove a fiery thing from inside it.

# Early Sessions:
We were hired by [[Nikolas Salvie (aka Nikolaj)]] in [[Skyhold]] to investigate a weirdness.  While traveling, we discovered several non-natural, dragon-like egg casing surrounded by a patch of burned grass.

After arriving, kobolds came and stole from [[Nikolas Salvie (aka Nikolaj)|Nikolaj]] (through a door Niki broke).  We got back most of the stuff, and murdered a small village in the process.  Erik diseased them (no one knows this in game) and Crystal burned children w/ alchemist's fire.  This included several clerics to [[Kurtulmak]] and [[Tiamat]].  Burning them lightened the mist that was forming.  That evening we murdered a bunch of boars and Derek salted the pork.  Later, we saw 20+ multi-colored wyverns fly overhead.

While waiting on [[Nikolas Salvie (aka Nikolaj)|Nikolaj]], we all did our thing.  Erik found an unnamed hedge wizard who was a master of diseases and spoke about future things that had no details from a Kevin. #todo

[[Nikolas Salvie (aka Nikolaj)|Nikolaj]] eventually came in with an associate ([[Dalmar Starkguard]]).  We briefed them and [[Nikolas Salvie (aka Nikolaj)|Nikolaj]] gave [[Dalmar Starkguard]] 5 pouches to send to [[Skyhold]], [[Bonera]], [[Bournsmouth]], [[Alewick]], and [[Arkala City|Arkala]].
#todo Are we delivering to Alewick?
	“We have an incredibly dangerous situation brewing north in the woods.  Whole tribes of kobolds seem to be following someone else’s directions N towards mountains near Gnomish [[Noxberry]] (town).  However there are no other indications of this.  Only indication is the lack of contact w/ nearby villages/people.  Very hard to find.  Please find any reason to find why they’d do this and prepare for action.”

After that, [[Nikolas Salvie (aka Nikolaj)|Nikolaj]] wants us to come with him towards [[Noxberry]] (where the kobolds were heading).  He hires [[Pricerus]], a half-elf hunter to lead us there.  On the way, we murder some Deinos, collect some herbalisms, and the mist gets more poisony.

We find some kobolds marching up a dry river, Erik diseases them again.  We come upon a bridge with a symbol of [[Tiamat]] in an antimagic field that is controlling the flow of water.  Niki bites it and breaks it, then we delve in after them (leaving [[Nikolas Salvie (aka Nikolaj)|Nikolaj]] and [[Pricerus]] behind with the horses).

Underground, we find some dead [[Fargo Wells]] messengers ([[Archie]] + 1), and more signs of kobolds and [[Tiamat]].  We found a map of the “path” and a note: “Deliver 3 crystals following general route within 2 white marble gazebo for [[Bahamut]].”

We find another city of Kobolds, this one in the process of murdering another [[Fargo Wells]].  Crystal swoops in and grabs a crystal while I disease them again.  As we head away, we find [[Louie]] melded into a wall and save him.

We get to a giant, magical marble dais that looks like where the crystals are supposed to be delivered.  More dead [[Fargo Wells]] nearby.  [[Louie]] dies of a heart attack in the evening.  Party doesn't know, but Erik did it so we don’t get tattled on for not delivering.  We continue on, travel through dwarf lands and via caravans to get back to [[Skyhold]], then wait for [[Nikolas Salvie (aka Nikolaj)|Nikolaj]] to catch up. #lightOrb 

[[Nikolas Salvie (aka Nikolaj)|Nikolaj]] is chased back by winged kobolds and deinonychus (maybe other things too?).  They apparently destroyed the dam mechanism before coming.  We defended [[Skyhold]] from a horde of Deinonychus that followed [[Nikolas Salvie (aka Nikolaj)|Nikolaj]], then built them a stone wall the next day while Brian briefed [[Nikolas Salvie (aka Nikolaj)|Nikolaj]] on our adventures.

Probably heading S to [[Alewick]] next, hopefully with a detour passed [[Mossley]] for an airship book.

###### heading to [[Mossley]] via [[Erast]]
On the way to [[Erast]], Crystal finds redcaps, but hands them off to Erik (needs result from Kevin later) #todo

After peacebonding weapons, we're allowed into [[Erast]].  Are given a symbol to Wee Jas after arm wrestling the Kord clerics.  Follow the people to a cage match.

After Niki fights (and destroys a dude using a potion of rage), we investigate, then head down the cave to a catacombs.  Find a temple to Wee Jas (more active than Kord’s) and find a holy book (Bible).

At sunup, screams of fear, dragons flying NW to SE (more W to E than N to S), 3-5 dragons/group.  More than 200 in total.
